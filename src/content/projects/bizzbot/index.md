BizzBot is an **AI-powered chatbot** that helps Nigerian entrepreneurs and business owners navigate trade, business registration, and tax-related questions with accuracy and clarity.

Running a business in Nigeria can be tough — rules around registration, taxes, and trade are often complex and confusing. Many small businesses don’t have access to reliable information, which leads to costly mistakes, delays, and missed opportunities.

BizzBot solves this problem by acting as a **free, always-available assistant** that provides clear, context-aware answers to business questions. From registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to understanding Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) tax policies, entrepreneurs can now make better, faster, and smarter decisions.
