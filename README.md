This portfolio site is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme, it's a futher development of the Astro Sphere by markhorn-dev and few other.

It is primarily Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, with a very small amount of SolidJS for stateful components. But added some reactjs to add my new features.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

Replace npm with your package manager of choice. `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`, etc
